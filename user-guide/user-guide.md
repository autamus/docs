## Why Autamus?
Using containers built by Autamus, you can install all of the software you need for your analysis in one container package. Then easily move your workflows between laptops, servers, and HPC clusters all while using the same container to drastically increase the portability of your research. Finally, don't worry about your containers using up all of your available disk space since Autamus strips out everything except the software you actually need in your container.
