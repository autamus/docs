# Contribute to Autamus
## Introduction
Hi there! Before we get started, I've got a few questions.
1. Do others think you're a total goofball sometimes?
2. Are you a nerd?
3. Has it been more than 2 days since you've remembered to go outside?

Any of those a yeah? Well welcome to the team! ðŸŽ‰

All we ask is that you keep an open-mind, are kind to others and try to have some fun! Oh and ask questions! There are no dumb questions! (Asking questions actually really helps us learn how to better tell other humans about Autamus.)

## Wanted Postings!
- **[Container Builders!]** We're always looking for people to find and add more containers to Autamus! Checkout [the registry](https://github.com/autamus/registry) to see if we're missing anything.

- **[Container Engineers!]** Sometimes containers break when they update. Ever think of yourself as Sherlock Holmes? Help us figure out what's going on with [these containers](https://github.com/autamus/registry/pulls)!

- **[Automation Wizards!]** Why do something when you can build something to do that thing for you? We're always looking for people to help make our [Autonomous workflows better](https://github.com/autamus?q=action&type=&language=&sort=)! (At the moment we'd love to start building a container testing system).
