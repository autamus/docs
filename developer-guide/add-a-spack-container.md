# Add a Spack Container to the Repository
## What's Spack?
Spack is a flexible package manager created to help manage the complexity of scientific software on HPC (High Performance Computing) environments. Spack makes Autamus possible by providing us with a standard way of building software from source. Spack is a super awesome project go [check it out here](https://github.com/spack/spack)! Although we're probably a little biased ðŸ˜‹.

## Instructions
1. Fork the registry [on GitHub](https://github.com/autamus/registry).
2. Clone your fork of the repository to your local computer.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/{YOUR_USERNAME}/registry
```
3. Create a directory with the name of your container under the `containers/` directory plus the first letter of the name of your container.
```bash
cd registry
mkdir containers/e/example/
```
4. Create a `spack.yaml` environment file with a list of the packages to be installed in your container from Spack.
```bash
nano containers/e/example/spack.yaml
```
```yaml
spack:
    specs:
        - example
        - example-friend
```
Make sure to check for the package you're looking for from the [Spack Repository](https://github.com/spack/spack/tree/develop/var/spack/repos/).

##### Want to be a Superhero?
5. (Optional) To help Autamus keep track of the Spack packages within your container please help us add their corresponding `package.py` files to Autamus.
6. (Optional) Save the Spack instructions or create your new ones within a `package.py` file within the `spack/first-letter-of-package/package-name` directory.

```bash
nano spack/a/ant/package.py
```
