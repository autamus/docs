# Hello!
Thanks for checking out Autamus! If you're a developer of a scientific or open source application please consider helping us add it to Autamus [through Spack](add-a-spack-container.md). If you do decide to help us out, make sure to come back after release an update of your application to see Autamus autonomously attempt to rebuild it!

If you're looking to get involved in Autamus (I swear we don't bite!...too much ðŸ˜œ) Checkout our [GitHub organization](https://github.com/autamus) and possibly the issues section on any of the repositories to get started helping to write a fix. If you'd like to say hi! Make sure to checkout our [Matrix Channel](https://matrix.to/#/!JZvPdVciSYDEVxNZHK:matrix.org?via=matrix.org).
